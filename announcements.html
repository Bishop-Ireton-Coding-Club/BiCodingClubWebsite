            Yes, you read that right: <i>Meetings</i>. Coding club wanted everyone to get a chance to get an in-
            person feel for the club so they hosted two seperate meetings. Of course, remote students could also join
            on the second day as well. Coding Club had the A-K members come on Wednesday, September 9 and the L-Z people, 
            remote people, and anyone who wanted to join but couldn't make it on Wednesday joined Coding Club on Friday,
            September 11 after school in room 313. Coding club had a great turnout and is super excited to kick the year off.
            For the first week, Coding Club wants to work on and teach Python! Time to learn how to code :)

              anyone in any Computer Science related club or society. The website is meant to be a place 
              for all Computer Science students at Bishop Ireton to come together and stay current on all 
              clubs and CSHS. The website is still in the process of being coded, but it is expected to look
              good in the fall!
