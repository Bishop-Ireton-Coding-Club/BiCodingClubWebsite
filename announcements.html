          <summary>Coding Club Takes on a Website! (8/13/2020)</summary>
            <li>
              Coding Club leaders have begun to code a website using HTML, CSS, and Javascript for 
              anyone in any Computer Science related club or society. The website is meant to be a place 
              for all Computer Science students at Bishop Ireton to come together and stay current on all 
              clubs and CSHS. The website is still in the process of being coded, but it is expected to look
              good in the fall!
